# 📊 Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project contains a data analysis workflow applied to a dataset downloaded from **Kaggle.com**. The analysis is performed using two different approaches:

1. **Python-based analysis** – leveraging `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`, and `Matplotlib` for data processing and visualization.
2. **Excel-based analysis** – utilizing built-in Excel functions, Pivot Tables, and charts for insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
### **Python Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)**
- `Python`
- `Pandas` – for data manipulation
- `NumPy` – for numerical operations
- `Seaborn` – for statistical data visualization
- `Matplotlib` – for plotting graphs

### **Excel Analysis**
- Pivot Tables & Charts
- Conditional Formatting
- Lookup & Aggregate Functions

## 📊 Key Insights
- [🔍] **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values, standardized formats.
- [📈] **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – statistical summaries, distribution plots.
- [📊] **Visualizations** – trends, correlations, and key insights from the dataset.
- [📉] **Comparison of Python vs. Excel** – differences in workflow, speed, and flexibility.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### **Python Analysis**
Open Jupyter Notebook for example in Google Colab.

### **Excel Analysis**
Open `.xlsx` file in Excel to explore the dashboard and pivot tables.
